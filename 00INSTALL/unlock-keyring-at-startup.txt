Need to alleviate Chrome's prompting for keyring password at startup.


The solution is to launch chrome with the --password-store=basic
argument to alleviate prompting for password.


Thu 20 Oct 2022 10:16:52 AM AKDT
================================
Launching chrome open popup prompting:

Enter password to unlock
An Application want access to the keyring "Default keyring", but it is locked
Password:

Chrome does this every time and it is a bit annoying.


Solution for command line
=========================
The solution is to use the --password-store=basic argument 
when lauching chrome.

Create /home/marcilr/bin/chrome script with:

#/bin/bash
/usr/bin/google-chrome --password-store=basic &

That did the trick for command line use.


Solution for Xfce toolbar bottem of screen
=========================================
Top apply fix to feh icon launch of Chrome

1. On feh toolbar
right-click Chrome icon
click Properies

2. At Launcher window:
click Google Chrome, Access the Internet
click Edit the currently seleted item

3. At Edit Launcher insert --password-store=basic to alleviate
password prompting to command:

Update:
usr/bin/google-chrome-stable %U

To:
usr/bin/google-chrome-stable --password-store=basic %U


Solution for Xfce pull-down top-left of screen
=============================================
Alright following the instructions below under
Chrome harasses me for a keychain password at startup:

1. Backup keyrings before removel:
$ sudo cp -r ~/.local/share/keyrings ~/keyrings-backup
[sudo] password for marcilr: ***
$

Verify backup:
$ ls -1 ~/.local/share/keyrings | wc -l 
$ ls -1 ~/keyrings-backup | wc -l

$ md5sum ~/.local/share/keyrings/*
5683ef7c8b0d5756215fc1d8f903e6eb  /home/marcilr/.local/share/keyrings/login.keyring
cee02560698f37280c2d6d65256b2511  /home/marcilr/.local/share/keyrings/user.keystore

$ sudo md5sum ~/keyrings-backup/*
5683ef7c8b0d5756215fc1d8f903e6eb  /home/marcilr/keyrings-backup/login.keyring
cee02560698f37280c2d6d65256b2511  /home/marcilr/keyrings-backup/user.keystore

Keyring backups look good.

2. Remove non-working keyring:
$ rm ~/.local/share/keyrings/*

3. Restart Chrome

4. When prompted to create a keyring, continue without entering a password. 
(Turns out you would have been okay if you did this the first time.)

Launching Chrome from Xfce > Internet > Google Chrome prompted
me with:

Choose password for keyring
An application wnat to create new keyring called "Default keyring."
Choose the password you want to use for it.

Password: <blank>
Confirm:  <blank>
click Continue

Store passwords unencrypted?
By choosing to use a blank password, your stored passwords will
not be safely encrypted.  They will be accessiable by anyone
with access to your files.
click Continue

This problem has a long history and you can fiddle around with gnome-keyring 
if you want, but I found that the easier solution is to set that prompt's 
password to blank, such that it won't ask you anymore:

1. rm ~/.local/share/keyrings/* (you may want to check/backup these files first, 
if you're not on a fresh install, 
e.g., cp -r ~/.local/share/keyrings ~/keyrings-backup)

2. Restart Chrome

3. When prompted to create a keyring, continue without entering a password. 
(Turns out you would have been okay if you did this the first time.)

  It's more than likely an Exec for a Desktop Entry Specification.
  %U - A list of URLs. Each URL is passed as a separate argument to the executable program. 
  Local files may either be passed as file: URLs or as file path.
