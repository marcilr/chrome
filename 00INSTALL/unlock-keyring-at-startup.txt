Need to alleviate Chrome's prompting for keyring password at startup.


The solution is to launch chrome with the --password-store=basic
argument to alleviate prompting for password.

================================
Launching chrome open popup prompting:

Enter password to unlock
An Application want access to the keyring "Default keyring", but it is locked
Password:

Chrome does this every time and it is a bit annoying.


Solution for command line
=========================
The solution is to use the --password-store=basic argument 
when lauching chrome.

Create /home/marcilr/bin/chrome script with:

#/bin/bash
/usr/bin/google-chrome --password-store=basic &

That did the trick for command line use.


Solution for feh toolbar Chrome execution
=========================================
Top apply fix to feh icon launch of Chrome

1. On feh toolbar
right-click Chrome icon
click Properies

2. At Launcher window:

3. At Edit Launcher insert --password-store=basic to alleviate
password prompting to command:

Update:
usr/bin/google-chrome-stable %U

To:
usr/bin/google-chrome-stable --password-store=basic %U

  It's more than likely an Exec for a Desktop Entry Specification.
  %U - A list of URLs. Each URL is passed as a separate argument to the executable program. 
  Local files may either be passed as file: URLs or as file path.
