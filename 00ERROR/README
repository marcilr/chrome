setuid-sandbox-is-not-running-as-root-20171025.txt
  On GCI covellite debian 8.9 amd64 I moved /opt to usb key.

  Now get chrome error:

  covellite:~$ google-chrome-stable
  The setuid sandbox is not running as root. Common causes:
    * An unprivileged process using ptrace on it, like a debugger.
    * A parent process set prctl(PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS, ...)
  Failed to move to new namespace: PID namespaces supported, \
  Network namespace supported, but failed: errno = Operation not permitted
  Trace/breakpoint trap
  covellite:~$
