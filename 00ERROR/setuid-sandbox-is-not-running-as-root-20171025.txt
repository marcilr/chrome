On GCI covellite debian 8.9 amd64 I moved /opt to usb key.

Now get chrome error:

covellite:~$ google-chrome-stable 
The setuid sandbox is not running as root. Common causes:
  * An unprivileged process using ptrace on it, like a debugger.
  * A parent process set prctl(PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS, ...)
Failed to move to new namespace: PID namespaces supported, \
Network namespace supported, but failed: errno = Operation not permitted
Trace/breakpoint trap
covellite:~$

I found the problem. The posts at 

https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=31077
https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues/938

have the solution.  The partition where chrome is installed shouldn't
be mounted with nosuid flag.  Getting rid of nosuid from the entry for
/opt in /etc/fstab solves the problem. 

From some of the comments there,

We hope to eliminate our SUID-based sandboxing in the near future.
But for now, we require the SUID helper for sandboxing.
---------------------------------------------

I wish the error message could be further improved by adding the
following as a common cause.

* The file system on which chrome is installed is mounted with the
  nosuid option

I had copied all of GCI covellite's /opt directory to the usb
key.  The easy solution was to only copy the contained 
DbVisualizer/ subdirectory and create a symlink under /opt/:

Move usb key's opt/DbVisualizer/
to usb keys's  bin/Dbvisualizer/
  $ cd /media/marcilr/ext4/opt
  # mv DbVisualizer/ ../bin/

Move opt/ from usb key back to /opt/
  $ cd /
  # rm opt
  # rsync -va --stats --progress /media/marcilr/ext4/opt .
  $ cd /opt

Create /opt/DbVisualizer/ symlink to usb key:
  $ cd /opt/
  # ln -s /media/marcilr/ext4/bin/DbVisualizer/
  $ type dbvis
  /home/marcilr/bin/dbvis
  $ ls -l /home/marcilr/bin/dbvis
  lrwxrwxrwx 1 marcilr marcilr 23 Oct 24 10:17 \
  /home/marcilr/bin/dbvis -> /opt/DbVisualizer/dbvis
  $

Looks good.
